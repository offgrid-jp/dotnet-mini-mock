/// captures the context value at the time it is started, so changes made to the ambient context
/// after the continuation starts are not visible to it.  Background threads started inside a

/// do not propagate back to the parent flow.  For these reasons, do <em>not</em> rely on
/// context isolation when spawning background work inside a shim scope — pass required rule
/// registrations explicitly instead.</para>
